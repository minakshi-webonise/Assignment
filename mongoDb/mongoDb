9. There are two types o data models
a. Embedded data model
b. Normalized data model

10. Commands

COllection creating and inserting data
		db.assesment.insert( 
		 {  name : "math",
		 questions : [ {
		 	q_id : 1,
			q_type : "math" ,
			q_name : "pythagorus thm", 
			options : 
				{ choice1 : "a",

			options : {
				choice1 : "a", 
				choice2 :"b", 
				choice3 : "c" 
				}
			}
		]

db.assesment.insert( 
		 {  id : 1 ,
		name : "math",
		 questions : [ {
		 	q_id : 1,
			q_type : "math" ,
			q_name : "pythagorus thm", 
			options : 
				{ choice1 : "a",
				  choice2 :"b", 
				  choice3 : "c"

			}]
		}
	);




Update QUery
db.assesment.update({id : 1, 'questions.q_id':1},{$set:{'questions.$.q_type':'math'}})





BASE
Basically Available
Soft state
Eventually consistent

	Non relation database follows BASE properties, database can grow vertically as well as horizontally. It doesn't have schema.
Basically available means is some part of database goes wrong, other data will be accessible to user, means some query goes wrong it doen't affect whole database.
Soft state means state of system may change, if we give input to it or some event occurs state may change, it is not fixed.
